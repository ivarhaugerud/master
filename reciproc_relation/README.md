# Reciprocal relation for advection-diffusion


## Code

The file ```MainClass.cpp``` and ```MainClass.hpp``` are the main file used for this section, while all other files run different functions contained in this class. 
In ```MainClass.hpp```, all the functions and global variabels contained in the class are defined. It therefore contain comments to give a brief description about the role of different parameters and functions.
How the variabels look and how the functions work is written in ```MainClass.cpp```, where the ammount of comments is sparse, but should be understandable in light of ```MainClass.hpp```.
The goal of the class is to solve the Navier--Stokes equations and the advection-difusion equation using the lattice-Boltzmann method. The class therefore contains all relevant boundary conditions, geometries, streaming and collision steps.

## Plot
All of the code used to plot and analyze the generated data is contained.
