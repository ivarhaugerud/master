# Reciprocal relation for advection-diffusion


## Code

The file ```MainClass.cpp``` and ```MainClass.hpp``` are the main files used for this section, while all other files run different functions contained in this class. 
In ```MainClass.hpp```, all the functions and global variables contained in the class are defined. It therefore contains comments to give a brief description of the role of different parameters and functions.
The use of variables and functions are contained  in ```MainClass.cpp```, where the amount of comments is sparse, but should be understandable in light of ```MainClass.hpp```.
The goal of the class is to solve the Navier--Stokes equations and the advection-diffusion equation using the lattice-Boltzmann method. The class, therefore, contains all relevant boundary conditions, initial conditions, geometries, unit tests, streaming and collision steps. The purpose of the other programs should be evident by the name of the file, and each is made with the purpose of investigating a specific scenario.

## Plot
All of the code used to plot and analyze the generated data is contained.
